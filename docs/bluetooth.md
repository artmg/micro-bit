## Connecting

The Samsung micro:bit Android App (LINK!) 
helps you to make a connection over bluetooth and flash your code

Along with the online editors at microbit.org this means 
you can do everything you want with just your phone! 
Of course it's not the ideal programming interface, 
but at least it's possible :)
