## About your 'online' microbit code

The easiest way to get started programming your micro:bit is 
with one of the with one of the online interfaces at

[http://microbit.org/code/]

These all store your scripts in your PCs local browser cache location, 
e.g. temporary internet files, perhaps under `m.pxt.io` or similar, 
so this means you can [work offline](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000013999-bbc-working-offline) too. 

Only registered teachers, BBC micro:bit partners and Code Club volunteers 
can have the online account that [lets you publish scripts](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000014028-bbc-how-do-i-publish-a-script), 
which you can understand with a tool aimed at 11 year olds.

The only way anyone else can save their work outside the browser 
is

* Original interfaces (URLs starting [https://www.microbit.co.uk/app/])
	- My scripts - select your script - [click on save](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000014019-bbc-how-do-i-save-my-scripts-i-am-a-student-)
		+ outputs a JSON file
* New PXT interface (URLs starting [https://pxt.microbit.org/?lang=en])
	- View your code in the Javascript pane
	- CTRL-A to Select All and CTRL-C to Copy
	- Open Notepad to create a new file and Paste your code
	- Save this file to your PC with the extension .js

Note that you can also save the .HEX file which contains your code, and this is the only output that the PXT project is currently planning to support (see [https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt/issues/886]), as they no longer support the old PXT file (see [https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt/issues/769])


## ways to share

_Here I'm looking for easy ways to do something like_

* _ write code locally and sync it with a git repo_
* other ways to share that consider safeguarding
*
